# Sports Photography

A lot goes into sports photography. Especially on the collegiate level, athletes move incredibly fast. Try tracking that on the other end of a telephoto lens. 

I've been photographing sports for about a year now. Since coming to BU, I've been to 3 WBB games (and some others), and somehow I feel myself retrograding in skill.

##### I judge my pictures by aesthetics and usefulness

By aesthetic I mean how well the composition works, since color is so maleable these days. And I don't have a hard and fast rule about what it means for composition to work, it just gotta. Too much free space? Crop. Not enough movement? Tilt. Focused on wrong person? Cry.

By usefulness I mean how well the information in the captured moment supplement existing information (scoreboard, recap, etc). Unusualness helps, and so does emotions. It is hard to show a witty juke but having a player on the floor is metaphor enough. Airborne moments are always nice, if the focus is spot on, face is visible, expression not too jarring...

##### The catch

Two paragraphs of "rules" is hardly any headache. There are some nuances specific to each sport like where you shoot from and where you are allowed to be, But those are easy to learn from any article.

The main things that trips me up is the ever-changing distance between my subjects and me. The range one has to cover for a sport like basketball is from less than 1m away to sometimes more than 30m away. 

Some photographers use a 70-200mm on the long end and a 28-70mm on the short end. That is at least $1.5k worth of lenses. For reference I have a Viltrox 23mm f1.2 (~40mm equiv) and a 75mm f1.2 (~112mm equiv), and I only have a Fuji XT-4 body.

My setup means that I am constantly being "overrun" by athletes sprinting down the court and into the paint. Chopped off hands, limbs, heads, disappearing balls, and lack of context have rendered unusable a number of otherwise very good photos.

*A mild example of all of the above*

Coming from event/editorial photography, I'm not used to the idea of carrying two bodies or spending an obscene amount of money on lenses. Film already costs so much.

There is definitely much to improve on my technique. I am not quite at one with the camera's focusing system yet, having only recently discovered back-button focusing. I am slow to track passes, follow jumps, notice emotional scenes, and separate key players from the multitude when they all bunch up in the paint. However, there is doubt on my mind on just how much my gear is holding me back. A 55-140mm f2.8 will set me back around $950.00 in times when I am very much unemployed. How much will that enable me to become a better photographer, and capture images that can begin to please myself?

I'm holding off on any big purchases for a while as a search for more opportunities in editorial, event, and photojournalism. I don't feel like I've found my true calling in sports photography, and I certainly do not consider what I'm producing art. 

I guess I still lack that **vision** of what I want to create, instead letting circumstances guide my lens and my shutter finger.

Below are some other unpublished works.
